# ensf400-lab8-kubernetes-2

## Objectives
This lab will teach us the scheduling, configmaps, canary and blue-green deployment strategies of Kubernetes. Through Minikube, a simplified Kubernetes engine running on a single computer, we practice the key concepts and usage of Kubernetes.

## Environment

### Set Up Your GitHub CodeSpaces Instance

Same as Lab 6, this lab will be performed in [GitHub CodeSpaces](https://github.com/codespaces). Create an instance using GitHub Codespaces. Choose repository `denoslab/ensf400-lab8-kubernetes-2`.


```bash
$ minikube start --nodes 3 -p ensf400
```

This step will start the Minikube service with 3 virtual nodes, stored in a profile called `ensf400`. If for some reason your Codespaces instance was stopped (e.g., not using it for a while). You can restart the minikube service using this profile by running:

```bash
$ minikube start -p ensf400
```

## Steps

Go to Section 7 - 10 and complete the steps for each section. The steps can be found in the `README.md` files in each subdirectory.

## Have Your Work Checked By a TA

The TA will check the completion of the following tasks:

- Output of Section 7.
- Output of Section 8.
- Output of Section 9.
- Output of Section 10.


Each member of the group should be able to answer all of the following questions. The TA will ask each person one question selected at random, and the student must be able to answer the question to get credit for the lab.

- Q1: Explain the scheduling strategy of Node Affinity and the scenarios to use it.
    -  After a user or a controller creates a Pod, the Kubernetes Scheduler, monitoring the Object Store for unassigned Pods, will assign the Pod to a Node. Allowing more control over where pods are scheduled based on the node characteristics
    - Some scenarios scheduling would be useful is hardware requirements and optimizaing resource utilization

- Q2: Explain the scheduling strategy of Pod Anti-Affinity and the scenarios to use it.
    - Pod anti-affinity allows us to accomplish the opposite of pod affinity, ensuring certain pods donâ€™t run on the same node as other pods.
    - Scenarios pod anti-affinity would be load balancing (spreading pods across different nodes)

- Q3: Explain the deployment strategy of blue-green deployment. How to switch between the two versions of deployments?
    - An application deployment strategy using which we can easily update one version named as BLUE while the another version named as GREEN will keep serving the request once done we can switch back to BLUE if required.
    - Command: kubectl patch service myapp -p '{"spec":{"selector":{"app": "green"}}}'
- Q4: Explain the deployment strategy of canary deployment. How to adjust the ratio of users getting serviced by the canary deployment?
    - Canary deployments are based on the routing of user traffic such that you can compare, test, and observe the behavior of any update for a small percentage of users
    - Changing the canary-weight will update the ratio of the users being serviced
